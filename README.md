# Y3S1_Image_Captioning_Using_Transformer

This is a project developed in undergraduate Year 3 - Semester 1

This repository is about an implementation of image captioning using the ResNet and Transformer Model.

In this project, we are going to build an image captioning model using CNN + Transformer 
Architecture. The dataset we used is an open-source dataset: Flickr 30K Dataset. This 
dataset contains 31,000 images collected from Flickr, together with 5 reference 
sentences provided by human annotators.
